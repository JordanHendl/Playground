Using https://github.com/JordanHendl/luna-gfx and https://github.com/assimp/assimp

Model is from https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/dia-world-flipper-vrc-free-download-d05161f79bef4310bc1b09f0c3ed2d38

Note: I'm not sure where the textures for the head are located in the source download. Inspecting the files, I don't see any textures for the head.
